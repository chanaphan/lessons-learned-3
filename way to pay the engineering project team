The appoach to pay for the project team depends on the scope, complexity and the objective of the projects. Each of them have diffenret advantages.
1. Pay by hour if the project needs more flexibility. 
For instance, the software is rquired to be released frequently;
or it requires the engeneers from all over the world and each of them contribute to small part of it with lots of variables and it's hard to pay by fixed bid.
2. Fixed bid is the relative more feasible and popular payment approah. There are several advantages. 
For example, fixed bid would increase the project team accountablity and efficiency because each one is measured by the final project outcome and it's least possible that the project team would like to extend the project period to get addional payment.
